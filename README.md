# Reverse Engineer Triangulation

Many reverse engineer workers have gone through the absolute pain of reverse engineering, taking about 40 days with 10 instances which is a lot for quite a lot of Central Processing Units. However, today that all changes.

In previous methods, reverse engineering attempts to recreate a program's binary code in order to deobfuscate it, however this process has been extremely lengthy in the past, that is why with Reverse Engineering Triangulation (now going to be referred to as RET) is the new solution.

RET uses approximations and complex equations in order to deliver a more accurate "guess" to the program's binary code. This reduces the time taken exponentially, and is shown to be at least 600% more powerful. Through parallel threads, you can reverse engineer something that would previously take 40 days in only 30 minutes. 

"Triangulation" is the process that this uses, it utilises an equation where it uses 3 binary code samples as far apart from each other, and uses this to precisely pinpoint the exact binary code in MINUTES. Running this triangulation process is slightly strenuous but since it does its job so quickly, there is no need for concern.

Here is a graph to show RET vs Standard Methods:
